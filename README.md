**Summary**

Four changes have been indicated within the results section above. Notably the removal of ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School remained in second place overall. The removal of an entire grade virtually had no affect on their overall placement within the district. The numbers indicate that Charter school outperformed District school at every level. The School Board and Super Intendent should look more closely into why this occurrence is happening. Its unusually, I would have assumed that charter schools across the board would have a larger budget per student, but the latter is actually true.

- Average Reading Score increased by 0.047152. The ninth grade class of Thomas High School were bringing the average reading down. The removal of them helped   
  increase the score.
